# BratwurstBot

A Twitter bot retweeting all things bratwurst written in NodeJS and using Firebase as a reliable cloud database. Accepting all kinds of feature requests.

## Keep 'em coming!

If you can fix the retweet problem which causes the bot not to retweet for hours in a row, even though the tweets are coming in, and are being analysed in the spam filter. No errors thrown; they are getting lost somewhere. The code is so simple and lightweight, but I just can't look through it. So if you have an idea open a issue or pull request!
